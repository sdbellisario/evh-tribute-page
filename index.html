            <!-- Brief history of EVH
      -->
     
            <p id="tribute-info">Edward Lodewijk Van Halen was one of the most creative and orginal guitarists in rock music history. His wild and adventurous playing style came to define hard rock guitar in the 1980s and beyond. With the band Van Halen (featuring his brother Alex on drums, Michael Anthony on bass guitar and David Lee Roth on vocals) they put of record after record of high intensity party music. Sammay Hagar joined in 1985 to replace Roth as the lead singer and their sound turned to more commercial oriented in the latter half of the decade and darker material in the 1990's. Gary Cherone briefly joined on vocals in 1998 for one record before the band went on a hiatus. 2004 saw a reunion with Hagar and finally a Roth reunion in 2007 leading towards their final record in 2012. While Eddie sadly passed away in October 2020, his music and legacy live on through the ears and fingers of eager and determined guitarists the world over.</p>
